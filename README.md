# Deck_of_Cards_CSharp
A simple C# application that creates a deck of cards, and allows for sort by ascending, and shuffle

Read me:

Please run the application with JetBrains Rider.
1) download and unzip the file
2) from the Rider menu select "open solution or project"
3) navigate to the file "DeckOfCards.sln" and click "Open"

NOTE: Rider Bug: Please not that there is a bug in the IDE that will cause “[6n” to be printed to the console anytime a Console.Readline() is executed. You can simply ignore this output and provide your input as though it were not there. See: https://rider-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/203366250-Console-Application-outputs-6n-

This is a console application intended to represent backend code. In order for the user to examine the results of the code execution, the deck will print to the console on start up, then after each sort or shuffle.
